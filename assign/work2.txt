Implement a working version of the linux “history” command. You need to accept the commands (in this case simply strings) from the user and update a history file. The following operations should be supported, 
a)	List all commands that were entered.
b)	List a specified number of commands (history n)
c)	List all commands with date and time stamp.
d)	List  the last command (!!)
e)	Ignore duplicate commands in history
f)	Delete or clear history of commands 
g)	Search with line number (! Line no)
h)	Search with substring of the command 
i)	Implement reverse searching of the command list. (See CTRL-R from the urls)

Note : In your case you need not have the run the commands. You need to have a program accepting user data.
You need to store the user data in a file as well as in a suitable data structure, so that the above operations are efficient enough.
