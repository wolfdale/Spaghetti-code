Write a program to do the following, 
a)	It should simulate the behavior of the  linux command “ls”. That is it fetches the details of all files and directories from a given path and displays it along with the file attributes to the user.
b)	While solving this, you need to use proper data structure to store the details for a file/directory. Preferably use functions from Glib library.
c)	 Note the following API’s that will help you fetch the raw   accounting information from the operating system’s records.
a.	opendir()
b.	readdir() 
c.	stat()

d)	The basic steps will be 
a.	Open a directory (to get the handle) using opendir
b.	In a loop call readdir to read the directory entries
i.	Handle cases for . and .. 
ii.	Populate the stat structure by calling stat (here you need to use the absolute name of a file or directory)
iii.	If you get a directory move down to this directory 
iv.	If you get a file print the attributes of this file.
